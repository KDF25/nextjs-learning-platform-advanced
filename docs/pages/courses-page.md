## Functionality

- Displays a **catalog of all available courses**, curated across multiple categories (e.g., Development, Design, Finance, Creativity, etc.).  
- Each course card typically contains:
  - **Thumbnail image / banner**
  - **Course title**
  - **Short description**
  - **Duration and level** (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
  - **Category label** (e.g., Development, Design & Creativity)
  - **Call-to-action button** (e.g., *Learn More*)  

- Clicking on a course card redirects the user to the **Course Details Page**, where they can explore full information and purchase/enroll.
